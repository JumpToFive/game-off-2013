Hyperspace Garbage Collection
===

At the multiverse juncture known as Alpha Omnicron Seven, `B0b`, a waste management systems machine, has been diligentily maintaining the Variadic Intergalactic Landfill for the past seven millenia. Day-to-day operations are automated, with the Landfill accepting both matter and anti-matter for processing and recycling. To avoid complete annihilation, waste shipments are temporally staggered.

A nineteenth generation Hyper-Fruit Inc. design, `B0b` features dual-mode materials handling, a regenerative zero-point energy power-plant, and a kinetic ramming mechanism.

Unfortunately, the Reptilian Corgiods of Universe 8N9 (∆*f* = 2.47 µHz) have teleported several millitons of antimatter space-poop through their garbage warp hole -0.2 seconds ahead of schedule.

The suboptimal imbalance of matter and anti-matter has resulted
in multiple catastrophic detonation events. Massive structural failures in the landfill loading dock have been reported. The cascade of radiation has overloaded B0b's artifical intelligence processes with soft errors.

Manual overrides have been activated. Guide `B0b` through the dangerous caverns of trash-heap to reach the Primary Systems Core and restore balance to the Trash.
